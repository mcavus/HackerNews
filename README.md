# Hacker News Reader

This is a simple reader app for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). It uses the official [Firebase-based Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

## Why?

I wanted to explore some concepts and build an app in the open.

## Getting Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/mcavus/HackerNews.git`
2. `cd HackerNews`
3. `pod install` (requires [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org))
4. Open `HackerNews.xcworkspace` in Xcode 9.4 or higher.

## Open Source & Copying

This app is available in the App Store for free, and licensed under [MIT](LICENSE). However, please do not ship this app under your own account.
